Some challanges i have faced :
Deploying the frontend and backend to multiple servers
Same domain different providers
CORS Cookies
Django Channels
Custom middleware to check channels authentication
Set cookies on request to the login/access/refresh
Used technologies:
tanstack router , tansatck queries for caching
Context layer for color mode in the frontend app
Axios JWTInterceptor for gain access token using the refresh token
